# Workshop 5: The 7th International Workshop on Democracy and AI
Recent advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and multi-agent systems have significantly increased the reach and influence of artificial intelligence (AI) in our everyday lives. AI-driven technologies are reshaping how we process, monitor, and manage information and services—with implications for evidence-based policy planning, decision-making, and public service delivery. Conversational AI tools, for instance, show great promise in enhancing democratic engagement by enabling scalable, inclusive, and participatory civic processes. These systems can help tailor public services, connect citizen ideas, and foster greater social inclusion. However, alongside these opportunities come significant risks. One of the central concerns is the lack of accountability in AI-generated content and decisions, which may profoundly impact individuals and communities by spreading misinformation or making opaque decisions. This workshop invites contributions that explore the current and future roles of AI in democratic contexts. We aim to foster a critical dialogue on how to harness AI for democratic good, while addressing the ethical, technical, and societal challenges it brings.

# Soceital Implementation of D-Agree: AN Online Dicussion Platform with AI Facilitation
## Takayuki Ho 

https://d-agree.com/site/en/

- Civic Participation
    - One-way communication 
    - Time and place constraints 
    - Pandemic restriction
    - Need for innovation 
- D-Agree is an AI factilitates online dcussion platform born from Japanese university research. It enables large-scale, asynchronous, text-based delibration unconstrained by time and space.
- AI recognizes new opinions - avoid spending a lot of time discussing the same point. 
- Address minor opinions that are important and might be ignored.
- In third world counties, people have smart phones, before they have a television.
- Wicked problems: United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
- Overview:
    - Topic Definition
    - Background Material
    - Extended Participation
    - AI Facilitation 
- Issues-Based Information System (IBIS)
- AI facilitator leverages natural language processing and large language modelling. 
- Anonymous posting - reduces status-bsaed pressure and encourages honest, candid feedback from all participants. 
- Case study: Kobe City
    - Based on pilot success, Kobe established a perminant "Citizen-to-Citzen Online Opinion Exhange Platform" using D-Agree, let by the Mayor's Office Public Relations Strategy Department since 2023. 
- In 2024, multiple deparments in Misashino City adopted D-Agree in parallel. The Education PLanning Divisio n used it to gather opinions on the "Four Musashino City School Education Plan" (2025-2029)
- Sapporo signed a collbration agreement on D-Agree in October 2023. Sension citizen courtesy pass. 
- Kabul Afganistan 2019-2021 Crisis Discourse -> After the American troops left Kabul city, they started to have a lot of issues.
- Benefits
    - Rapid development
    - Reduced workload
    - Knowledge building
- Challenges
    - Digital divide
    - Sustained engagement 
    - Trust and integration 
- Online platofrms like D-Agree demosntrate strong potential in education and youth civic engagement. In Mushashino, students used D-Agree to discuss their school life and propose concrete improvements - functioning as citizenship educuation.
- Safety measures - guardrails, AI filters, and administrator controls support safe, constructive discussions. 
- Governance - embedding platforms in institutual and legal frameworks. 
- Toward digital demoncracy with Human-AI collaboration.
- AI facilitation 
    - aims to capture the semantics of the conversation (ideal).
    - initially used rules-based system, then BERT, then LLMs.
    - manually annotated dataset.
    - AI agent just gather the opinions and structures them.s

# Detecting and Explaining Deliberative Transformation with the Discourse Quality Index: Insights from Experimental Discussions on rRemoved Soil in Fukushima
## Takashi Nakazawa 

- Discourse Quality Index
    - Original DQI: Haraermasian norms (options based on reasons, respect, proposals/alternatives)
    - Evolving measure: incorporates alternative communication (e.g., storytelling)
    - Common good expanded: utilitarianism., distributibutive justice, maximum principle.
- Factor analysis with varimax rotation.
- Detecting and explaining turning-points by PELT.
- Common patterns observed downward shifts
    - Confirming the procedure of the discussion or the final decision-masking
    - Verifying which issues should be disucssed. 
- F1 (Habermasian deliberative norms)
    - new perspectives or approaches were introduces 
    - The topic shifted
    - Reasons were requested 
    - Reviewing and reinforcing arguments. 
- F2 (utilitarnism)
    - topic transitions to reuse/long-term storages 
    - Returns from fact-checking to sustantive issues
    - Questions asking for reasons 
- Jürgen Habermas is a German philosopher and social theorist in the tradition of critical theory and pragmatism. His work addresses communicative rationality and the public sphere. Wikipedia

# Post-2021 Afganistain-inflected issues pertaining to the imagination and implementation of online eductation for girl's learning
## Jawad Haqbeen

- Since the Taliban regained control in 2021, girls and women in Afganistan have been prohibited from attending secondary and higher education institutions.
- 1 teacher, 100 students, Zoom 
- Research
    - Online learning is a mode of education delivered through digital platforms.
    - Research has shown a teacher that can teach 20 in person, can only tech 10 online. 
- A large-scale study with GPT-4 found improved problem-sovling - but also dependency risks if AI access is removed. 
- Relying on AI tools like ChatGPT affect student's cognitive engagement during writing, weaken neural activity, and orginality, raising questions about how students use AI in education. 
- Design and apply a convervating use of GPT-4 based agent (few shot and prompt-engineerged for learning support) as a conversational agent to support engagement and learning using OPenAI's GPT-3 model. 
- To enhance the conssitency and instructional quality of the agent's interventions, we employed a controlled prompt adaptation strategy. Rather than allowing GPT-4 to generate facilitation content entirely from scratch, we curated a set of 17 human-authored facliation messages, which served as the core of the chatbot's interaction library.
- Randmized controlled trial (RCT) with 8p undergraduate computer science students.
- Hyper Democracy user interface.
- Treatment groups posted significantly more posting per student than the control.
- Post-intervention survey, 7 point Likert scale. 

> The internet ban is yet another way for the Taliban to control women and girls. Since taking control of Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban have severely curtailed all physical spaces of resistance: from the streets, to universities, to workplaces.30 Sept 2025
